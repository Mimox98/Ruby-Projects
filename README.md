# Ruby-Projects
Welcome to **ruby-projects** â€” a personal collection of Ruby practice projects ranging from **easy** to **hard**.

## ðŸš€ About

This repository is where Iâ€™m building and collecting Ruby projects to:

- Practice core Ruby syntax and features
- Improve problem-solving with real code challenges
- Explore different aspects of Ruby, from simple scripts to more advanced topics

Each project is organized by difficulty level and may include documentation, tests, or notes explaining the approach.
