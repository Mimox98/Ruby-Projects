## 📚 About

This repository is where I’m building and collecting Ruby projects. It contains a collection of Ruby practice projects, ranging from **easy** to **challenging**, built to deepen my understanding of the Ruby programming language.

Each project explores different topics including:

- Basic syntax and control flow
- Methods and string manipulation
- Object-oriented programming
- Algorithmic thinking
- Explore different aspects of Ruby, from simple scripts to more advanced topics

Each project is organized by difficulty level and may include documentation, tests, or notes explaining the approach.
